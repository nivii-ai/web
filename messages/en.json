We start by working with you to identify the most reliable data sources and build \"Domain Data Products.\" This allows us to clean, transform, and use the most trustworthy parts of your data first, delivering immediate value and impact while creating a foundation for ongoing data quality improvement."

          "question": "Is this like ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini?",
          "answer": "While we leverage the power of leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Nivii is much more than a simple chat interface. Our core technology is a proprietary orchestra of specialized AI agents. These agents are trained on your business context and work together to perform deep, accurate analysis. Unlike general-purpose models, Nivii's goal isn't just to generate text or charts—it's to deliver validated, decision-ready insights."

        {
          "question": "How do you ensure accuracy?",
          "answer": "Accuracy is critical, especially when decisions are on the line. Our multi-layered approach is built to ensure it. First, we ground all analysis in your most trusted data sources. Second, our orchestra of AI agents breaks down complex questions and assigns the right agent to each part of the analysis. Finally, we use a proprietary validation framework, including \"Judge\" agents, to cross-check results, minimize errors, and prevent the hallucinations that general AI models are prone to."

          "question": "Can you connect to SAP/Salesforce/others?",
